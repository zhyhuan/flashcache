this is an initial guide on getting flashcache building on CentOS, which was extremely helpful.

 - If you want to compile flashcache on centos 6, you should first upgrade your linux kernel:
   For single proc boxes type:
   	sudo yum upgrade kernel	
   For dual proc boxes type:
   	yum upgrade kernel-smp
 - Install prerequisite build packages:
   yum install dkms gcc make yum-utils kernel-devel
 - CentOS kernel-headers/devel packages don't include internal headers, we've got to configure the full source:
   yumdownloader --source kernel-`uname -r`
	 sudo rpm -ivh kernel-`uname -r`.src.rpm
	 
 - then you can just run:
 	make or make KERNEL_TREE=<root of the kernel source tree>(if your kernel source tree isn't installed 
 	in the default directory)
 	
 	
 This builds both the flashcache.ko and 3 utilities.
